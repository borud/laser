# Laser controller

I'm not sure this is interesting to anyone but me.  This repository
contains some Arduino code to control the focus and firing of a laser
so that I can experiment with it at a safe distance.

The code isn't done yet since it doesn't contain any of the stuff for
actually firing the laser.

## CustomStepper

Since this library isn't available in the official Arduino library
manager I decided to include it.  You will have to copy (or symlink)
this directory into your Arduino/libraries directory to use it.  I am
including it as a convenience so you won't have to go on an easter egg
hunt.
